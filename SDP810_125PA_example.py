#Reading the Sensirion SDP810 125PA (or 500PA will need modification) sensor
#Dev by JJ SlabbertSDP810_example
#Code tested with Python 2.7
#Run sudo i2cdetect -y 1 in the terminal, to see if the sensor is connected. it will show address 25
#Check the datasheet at https://www.sensirion.com/fileadmin/user_upload/customers/sensirion/Dokumente/0_Datasheets/Differential_Pressure/Sensirion_Differential_Pressure_Sensors_SDP8xx_Digital_Datasheet.pdf
#The sensor i2c address is 0x25 (Not user Programable).
#I have no formal electronics, physics or programing education, code should be tested before critical applications
#Code should be compatable with sdp810, sdp800 sdp811 and sdp801
